/**
 * @brief Implements the combination of two genotype subtables and subsequent
 * contingency table computation. The function is a fork of the function
 * ``builtin_popcnt_unrolled_errata`` from
 * https://github.com/WojciechMula/sse-popcount/tree/6feb3dba32c526b17de01e931c116900e3a23104
 * modified to interleave the genotype table combination operations with the
 * `popcount` operations.
